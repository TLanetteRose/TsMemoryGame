## Welcome and Background

Welcome to my first **Memory Game**. (Actually, it’s my third one, and the one that works.)  I want to say thank you to [Sandra Israel-Ovirih] for her tutorial about designing a memory game. JavaScript is not my strongest area. Ms. Israel-Ovirih included guidelines for planning this project. My goal was to produce a memory game with a cover image and the group of matching images on the other side of the card. I’m still working on that version. This version uses the **Font Awesome**  icons and a special trick to keep them hidden…So, let’s talk about my project!

## Instructions

I remember playing **Concentration** with a deck of playing cards when I was a little girl. It was a thrill to see if I could remember where the matching cards were located. That’s the same concept in my memory game. There are 16 cards with different icons. Players can test their skills at remembering where the matching icons are located. The matching cards will stay open and display as a turquoise blue. The unmatched cards will do a little (very tiny) movement and turn reddish-pink before they turn over. 

## Dependencies

This game uses the following library(s):
-  [Font Awesome] : used for the icons in the memory game
-  [Google Fonts] : Open Sans was used for the body font and Spicy Rice was used for the titles

## Installations 

There are no other installations for this game.

## How I Created My Game

I received the HTML, CSS, and JS files from my [Udacity] program. I then added my own CSS styling to the program. Since I am still learning JS, I did research other tutorials about making  memory programs. I learned that there are different formats for designing this game. 
One new skill I tried was adding elements and classes to the DOM using JS. However, I had difficulty getting my front and back images to work. So, I will keep working on that  project to share later. In this project, I used the unordered list in my HTML to set up my cards. My goal is to continue improving my JS skills so that I can program the game without tutorials.
